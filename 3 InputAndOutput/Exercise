create a program that takes input and displays them after all
of the inputs are entered.

you can use:
    next();
    nextInt();
    nextLine();
    nextDouble();
    hasnext();

input should be:
    Hello this is a ladder progression
    1010.02
    2

output should be:
    String : Hello this is a ladder progression
    Double : 1010.02
    Int : 2

Note :
    nextInt and nextDouble only scans numbers.
    if you get stuck call nextLine to move to the nextline
